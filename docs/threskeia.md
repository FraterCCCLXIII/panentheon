Latin Name: Ordinatio Sacerdotis
This rite consecrates an individual into the priesthood, formally recognizing their responsibility as a spiritual guide and intermediary between the sacred and the community.

It incorporates purification rites, symbolic gestures of responsibility, and prayers invoking the sacred Logos.

Rite of Ascent to the Mountain Seat
Greek Name: Ἀνάβασις Ἐς Τὸ Ὄρος (Anábasis es to Óros)

The person ascending the "Mountain Seat" symbolizes their having attained a deep level of insight and spiritual authority, which qualifies them to lead others along the path of spiritual ascent. The rite begins with symbolic purification and a ritual journey, culminating in the official assumption of the seat of spiritual authority, often associated with a "cosmic throne" reflecting both human and divine responsibility.
