**NOTE: Currently this list is not exhaustive and is loosely defininig the people listed as "contributors" although they may not self-identify as Universal Panentheists. In the future it we will be exploring a taxonomy for how we make distinctions between the type of contributor: Scholar, Teacher, Activist, Leader, Philosopher, and Sage. Further, we will be exploring of how to include the many extraordinary beings from the vast array of spiritual traditions into this list. For now this list emphasizes the great contributors of the Academy, the Platonic schools, including the Stoics and Pyrrhonists, as part of an ancient Western nondual current that has always been in harmony with the Eastern nondual traditions and emphasizes our ability to continually integrate new ideas and knowledge into our religious and spiritual language.**

Universal Panentheism is inherently trans-traditional, recognizing that the expressions of divine truth—through both Logos (reason, order) and Eros (love, creativity)—manifest across many cultures and religious traditions. This inclusive philosophy supports religious pluralism, affirming that no single tradition holds exclusive access to the divine or the ultimate truth, which would be an inversion of the true relationship of religion to the divine. Instead, it honors the collective contributions of saints, sages, philosophers, and enlightened beings from diverse spiritual lineages as part of our shared human heritage. Together, these voices have helped humanity articulate and investigate the nature of reality, weaving a rich, interconnected tapestry of wisdom that transcends doctrinal boundaries while revealing the deeper, universal dimensions of existence. This list does not represent a list of saints in the Christian sense, or a list of enlightened beings in the Buddhist or Hindu sense.
