# Panentheon

Welcome to Panentheon, a collaborative project dedicated to exploring and presenting an evolutionary panentheism as a meta-religion and spiritual orientation. Our aim is to integrate the teachings and insights of various spiritual and philosophical traditions into a comprehensive guide that is rational, scientific, and deeply human.
