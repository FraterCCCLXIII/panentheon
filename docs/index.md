# Defining the Meta-Religion

Panentheon is a collaborative project dedicated to exploring and presenting what can be called Evolutionary Panentheism or Process Panentheism (among others) as a meta-religion and comprehensive philosophical system. Our aim is to integrate the teachings and insights of various spiritual and philosophical traditions, individual teachers and philosophers, and texts into a comprehensive framework that is enlightening and deeply human.
