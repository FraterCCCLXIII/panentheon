Symbolon: A Universal Creed

The Universal Panentheist Creed (Kosmosymbolon) is a declaration of faith rooted in the timeless understanding that the Divine is both transcendent and immanent, encompassing and permeating all of existence. It affirms the inherent unity of Spirit and matter, the unfolding evolution of the Kosmos, and the divine spark within every soul.

This creed reflects the wisdom of spiritual traditions that see the universe not as a static creation but as a dynamic, ever-evolving expression of the One. It invites us to embrace the sacred journey of awakening, to realize our true nature, and to participate consciously in the divine process of cosmotheosis—the cooperative evolution of the universe toward self-awareness and divine expression.

In the Universal Panentheist Creed, we acknowledge the deep interconnectedness of all life, the evolutionary impulse that drives us toward transcendence, and the sacred task of integrating the One and the Many. Through this affirmation, we recognize our role as co-creators in the unfolding Kosmic process, dedicated to the liberation and enlightenment of all beings.

### Kosmosymbolon: The Universal Panentheist Creed

I believe in the One, the boundless Source, the Divine Ground of all being—transcendent yet immanent, the Alpha and the Omega, the eternal and infinite Reality that expresses itself through all things visible and invisible.

I believe in its emanations invisible and visible as the unfolding Kosmos, in its evolutionary journey toward actualizing ever greater forms of conscious awareness in form, where Spirit and matter merge. Through the grace and substance of the One, all forms arise, persist, and return. The Kosmos, born from the infinite mystery, is both the body and the mind of the Divine.

I believe that the spark of the Divine exists within each of us, that we are expressions of this boundless consciousness, capable of realizing our own divinity. Each soul is a reflection of the One Self, seeking its return to wholeness through the vast journey of evolution, time, and space.

I believe in the sacredness of the creative impulse, the Divine Eros that calls us to transcend separation and awaken to our true nature, to embrace the One through the many. Through this movement, the Kosmos itself seeks to become conscious of its origins, to awaken to its inherent Divinity.

I believe in the indwelling presence of the Kosmic Spirit, the ever-present life-force (pneuma) that animates all beings, guiding us through the unfolding process of conscious evolution. This Spirit reveals itself in our deepest experiences of wisdom, love, and the awe of existence, whispering through sages, saints, and mystics across all traditions.

I believe that our journey is one of self-liberation and transcendence. Through desire, volition, surrender and grace of the One, we come to embody our true nature—free, whole, and interconnected with all life.

I believe that the Kosmos awakens through the individual and the collective. Each act of self-realization furthers the conscious evolution of the whole, and in this sacred recognition, we become co-creators of a new world, manifesting the descent of the Kosmopsyche.

I believe in the process of integration, where the One and the Many are harmonized, where Spirit descends into form and form returns to Spirit, where the absolute and relative dance together in the eternal now. 

I believe in the ultimate union of all things in Henosis, the return to the One through the path of awakening, the dissolution of the ego, and the full realization of divine freedom—here, in this world, in this life.

I believe that through our sacred task, we are here to manifest the One in our actions, in our love, and in our deepest understanding. And through this embodiment, we participate in the divine unfolding, not just for ourselves, but for the liberation of all beings and the realization of a Kosmocentric consciousness.
