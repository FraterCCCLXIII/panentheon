The Interpretatio Universalis is a modern development rooted in the ancient practice of Interpretatio Graeca and Interpretatio Romana, where the Greeks and Romans sought to understand and equate foreign gods with their own deities. This practice enabled the integration of different religious traditions within the expanding empires, fostering a form of religious pluralism and a means for all foreign traditions to be accepted within a larger religious framework. The Greeks and Romans, through their cosmopolitan approach, created a framework for mutual recognition and synthesis of divine figures, which helped maintain social and political harmony across diverse cultures. Interpretatio Universalis builds on this concept, applying it more globally. It goes beyond merely comparing gods and instead seeks to interpret, integrate, and synthesize religious ideas, figures, and practices from a wide range of cultures. In doing so, it acknowledges the universal threads running through different spiritual expressions while respecting their distinctiveness, fostering a transcultural and trans-religious understanding of the divine. This inclusive approach seeks to foster an **aligned** religious pluralism that supports unity in diversity with a common vocabulary.
