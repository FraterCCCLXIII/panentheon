# Typikon

The **Typikon** (Greek: Τυπικόν) prescribes the rules, ceremonies, and guidelines that govern the structure and flow of practice and services, providing a detailed description of prayers, hymns, rituals, and the various vestments worn by the community (thiasus) during ceremony, celebrations, retreat, monastic life, and so forth. Rooted in centuries of tradition, the Typikon not only outlines the spiritual rhythm of the calendar but also acts as a living document, offering guidance for the expression of faith through the clothing and symbols used in worship.
